### Briefly about myself
She started her career in 2018 after graduating from university. Almost immediately she began working as the sole legal adviser in a group of companies in the field of international cargo transportation. At that stage I gained important experience and necessary skills.
Since 2021, I started working in one of the largest online stores in the Republic of Belarus as part of a legal team. I oversee the implementation of many important projects from a compliance perspective and help realize business ambitions.
Partially remote work gives me the opportunity to effectively manage my time, explore new directions and develop my skills. So now I'm studying a course at Rolling Scopes to immerse myself in a new world for me.
